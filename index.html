                            <i class="heading"><strong class="heading">A book is a set of printed sheets of paper held
                                    together between two covers.</strong></i> The sheets of paper
                            are usually covered with a text, language and illustrations that is the main point of a printed
                            book.
    
                            A writer of a book is called an author. Someone who draws pictures in a book is called an
                            illustrator. Books can have more than one author or illustrator.
    
                            A book can also be a text in a larger collection of texts. That way a book is perhaps written by
                            one author, or it only treats one subject area. Books in this sense can often be understood
                            without knowing the whole collection. Examples are the Bible, the Illiad or the Odyssey – all of
                            them consist of a number of books in this sense of the word. Encyclopedias often have separate
                            articles written by different people, and published as separate volumes. Each volume is a book.
    
                            Hardcover books have hard covers made of cardboard covered in cloth or leather and are usually
                            sewn together. Paperback books have covers of stiff paper and are usually glued together. The
                            words in books can be read aloud and recorded on tapes or compact discs. These are called
                            "audiobooks".
    
                            Books can be borrowed from a library or bought from a bookstore. People can make their own books
                            and fill them with family photos, drawings, or their own writing. Some books are empty inside,
                            like a diary, address book, or photo album. Most of the time, the word "book" means that the
                            pages inside have words printed or written on them.
    
                            Some books are written just for children, or for entertainment, while other books are for
                            studying something in school such as math or history. Many books have photographs or drawings.

                            A common type of manuscript was the scroll, which was a long sheet rolled up. The sheet could
                            have been made of papyrus (made by the Egyptians, by weaving the inner stems of the papyrus
                            plant and then hammering them together), or parchment or vellum (very thin animal skin, first
                            used by the ancient Greeks). Later, paper made from plant fibers was invented by the Chinese).
                            Scrolls were the usual form until the 16th century. Turning the manuscript into a book required
                            several developments.

                            The Romans were the first people to put separate pieces of manuscript between covers, to form a
                            codex. This was more convenient to handle and store than scrolls, but was not yet a book as we
                            understand it.

                            Scrolls and codices were written and copied by hand. The Chinese invented woodblock printing,
                            where shapes are carved out of a block of wood, then ink is applied to the carved side, and the
                            block is pressed onto paper. This woodcut method was slow because the symbols and pictures were
                            made by cutting away the surrounding wood.
    
                            Johannes Gutenberg was the first to invent a machine for printing, the printing press, in the
                            15th century. It combined a press, based on a wine press, and movable metal type suitable for
                            the machine process.
    
                            Initially, the machines were slow, and needed a printer's muscle to make them work. The
                            Industrial Revolution brought steam power and later electrification.

                            Paper had been invented in China in the 8th century, but it was kept secret for a long time. In
                            Europe hand-made paper was available from about 1450. It was cheaper than parchment but still
                            expensive, and the early printing was a slow process. Therefore, books remained rare. In 1800
                            the first machines for making paper from wood pulp were invented. New kinds of inks were also
                            invented for various purposes, and machines were driven by steam engines and later by electric
                            motors.[4]
    
                            The common cheap supply of paper fed the faster printing machines, and books became cheaper. At
                            the same time, in America, Britain and continental Europe, more people learnt to read. So, in
                            the 19th century, many ordinary people could afford to buy books and could actually read them.
                            Also in the 19th century came public libraries, so poorer people could get access to the best
                            books.

                            Printing was done on large sheets of paper, which were then folded, guillotined (cut) and sewn
                            into the covers. Bookbinding and all the other processes have been done by machines since the
                            19th century.
